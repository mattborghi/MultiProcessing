# It is possible to use apply_async() without providing a callback function. 
# Only that, if you donâ€™t provide a callback, then you get a list of pool.ApplyResult 
# objects which contains the computed output values from each process. 
# From this, you need to use the pool.ApplyResult.get() method to retrieve the desired final result.

# Parallel processing with Pool.apply_async() without callback function
